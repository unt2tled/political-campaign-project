Fewer Americans are working today than when President Obama took office. It doesn't have to 
"be this way. If Obama would stand up to China. China is stealing American ideas and technology, "
everything from computers to fighter jets. Seven times Obama could have taken action. Seven 
times he said no. His policies cost us 2 million jobs. Obama had years to stand up to China. We 
can't afford four more. I met Romney and I approve this message.
