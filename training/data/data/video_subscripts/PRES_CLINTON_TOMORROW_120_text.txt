I think we can all agree. It's been a long campaign. But tomorrow you get to pick our next president. 
So here are a few things that I hope you'll think about first. It's not just my name and my opponents 
name on the ballot. It's the kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren is America 
"dark and divisive, or hopeful and inclusive. Our core values are being tested in this election, "
"but everywhere I go, people are refusing to be Defined by fear and division. Look, we all know "
"we've come through some hard Economic Times. And we've seen some pretty big changes, but I believe "
in our people. I love this country and I'm convinced our best days are still ahead of us. If we 
reach for them together. I want to be a president for all Americans. Not just those who support 
me in this election for everyone because we all have a role to play in building a stronger fairer. 
Am Erica. The second thing I want you to know is this? I will work my heart out as president to make 
life better for  
"you and your family. We won't always get it right, but you can count on this. I've never quit and "
"I never will. I'll get up every day. Determined to keep America safe and strong, and make our "
economy work for everyone. Not just those at the top. And finally working for Children and Families 
"has been the cause of my life, but it's Has never been more important than it is right. Now. This "
"has to be our mission together. To give our kids and every American, the chance to live up to their "
"god-given potential. So tonight. I'm asking for your vote, and tomorrow. Let's make history "
together. I'm Hillary Clinton. And one last time I approve this message.
