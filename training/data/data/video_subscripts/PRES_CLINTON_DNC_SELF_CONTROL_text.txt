I spent many years as a nuclear missile launch officer. If the President gave the order, we had 
to launch the missiles, that would be it. I prayed that call would never come. Selfcontrol may 
be all that keeps these missiles fire. I would bomb the out of him. I want to be unpredictable. 
I love war. The thought of Donald Trump with nuclear weapons scares me to death. Scare everyone. 
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
