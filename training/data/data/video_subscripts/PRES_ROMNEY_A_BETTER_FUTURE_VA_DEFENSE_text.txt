"This President can ask us to be patient. This President can tell us it was someone else's fault, "
but this President cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office here 
in Virginia. We're not better off under President Obama. His defense cuts will weaken national 
"security and threaten over 130,000 jobs. Romney's plan reverse Obama defense cuts strengthen "
"our military and create over 340,000 new jobs for Virginia. I met Romney and I approve this message. "
