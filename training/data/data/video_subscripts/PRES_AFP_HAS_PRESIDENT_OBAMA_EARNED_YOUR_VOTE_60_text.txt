"In 2008, I voted for President Obama with no reluctance. He presented himself as something "
"different. I had hoped that the new President would bring new jobs, not major layoffs, not people "
"going through major foreclosures on their homes. He did get his health care through, but at "
what cost? He said he was going to cut the deficit in his first term. I've seen zero interest in 
"reducing spending. He inherited a bad situation, but he made it worse. I think he's a great person. "
"I don't feel he is the right leader for our country, though. I still believe in hope and change. "
I just don't think Obama is the way to go for that. The President has not earned reelection in 
"2012. In my book, I've seen his now definition hope and change. It's not the hope and change I "
want. It's not the hope and change I thought I was going to get. I don't feel that I helped my grandchildren 
by voting for President Obama. And I regret that Americans for Prosperity is responsible for
