It's one of the hardest decisions a family can make realizing a nursing home is the only choice 
for many middle-class families. Medicaid is the only way to afford the care. But as a governor 
"Mitt Romney raised nursing home fees, eight times and is President, his budget cuts, Medicaid "
"by one-third, and burdens families. With the cost of nursing home care. We have a president "
who won't let that happen. I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.
