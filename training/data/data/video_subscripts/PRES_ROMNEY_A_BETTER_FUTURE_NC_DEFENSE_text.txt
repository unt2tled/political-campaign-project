"The President can ask us to be patient. This President can tell us it was someone else's fault, "
but this President cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office here 
in North Carolina. We're not better off under President Obama. His defense cuts will weaken 
and national security and threaten thousands of North Carolina jobs. Romney's plan reverse 
"Obama defense cuts strengthen our military, create over 350,000 new jobs for North Carolina. "
I met Romney and I approve this message.
