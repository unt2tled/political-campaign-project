"I'm Barack Obama and I approved this message. When the auto industry faced collapse, Mitt Romney "
turned his back. Even the Detroit News criticized Romney for his wrongheadedness on the bailout. 
President Obama took a stand for American jobs. Don't fail against the American workers. And 
Michigan's auto industry is back. So remember what Mitt Romney said. That's exactly what I 
"said. The headline you read, which said, Let Detroit go bankrupt and what President Obama did "
for Michigan.
