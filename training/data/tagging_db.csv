Grace is an absolute blessing in our lives. She brings tremendous joy to so many lives all around her. Her presence has helped them understand that people with disabilities are just like us. when I saw that clip of Donald Trump mocking somebody with a disability, It's stunned me. I was shocked. You got to see this guy, I don't know what I said. I don't remember. that reporter he is talking about suffers from a chronic condition of a movement of his arms.
