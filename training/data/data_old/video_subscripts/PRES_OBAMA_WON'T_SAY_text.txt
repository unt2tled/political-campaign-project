I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message. Mitt Romney. He won't reveal what's in his taxes 
and he won't tell you what he'd do to yours to pay for huge new tax breaks for millionaires. Like 
"him. Romney would have to raise taxes on the middle class, two thousand dollars for a family. "
"With children says, a nonpartisan report. You could lose the deduction for your home mortgage "
College. Tuition health care. How much would you pay? Romney just won't say
