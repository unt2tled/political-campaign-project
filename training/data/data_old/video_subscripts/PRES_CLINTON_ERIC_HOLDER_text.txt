Republicans weren't going after President Obama. They were coming after me. His attorney 
"general, and the cabin and I served with Hillary Clinton. You have known her for almost 25 years. "
"This is the woman who's for her whole life from children, to protect Civil Rights, Voting Rights "
"and stay. Hilary, is pushing hard for tougher gun laws and police accountability. If you want "
to make sure Republicans don't take us backward. Help Hillary move us forward. I know Ray Clinton 
and I approve this message.
