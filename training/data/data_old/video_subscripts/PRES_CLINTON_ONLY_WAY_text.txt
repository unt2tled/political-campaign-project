I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message. Donald Trump says he alone can fix the problems 
"we face. Well, I don't believe that's how you get things done in our country. It takes Democrats "
"and Republicans working together. That's how we got health care for 8 million, kids rebuilt, "
New York City after 9/11 and got the treaty hiding Russia's nuclear arms. We've got to bring 
people together. That's how you solve problems. And that's what I'll do as president.
