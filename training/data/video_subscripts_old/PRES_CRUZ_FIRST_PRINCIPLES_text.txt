Barack Obama sticks by his principles. It's time for Republicans to stand by ours. That's how 
we win. And that's how I'll lead as president. I won't compromise the values that make us who 
"we are. The Constitution wasn't a first draft. Our border isn't a revolving door, and the rule "
"of law wasn't meant to be broken. America is off track, but our founding principles will get "
us back. I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message.
