"Dear Hillary Clinton. I'd like to ask you, why you ignored calls for help in Benghazi and then "
four Americans were murdered. I'd like to know why you lied saying the attack was response to 
"an internet video. I'd like to hear what you tried to silence the Benghazi whistleblower, but "
mrs. Clinton. I can't. What difference does it make?  
Stop Hillary back. This responsible for the content of this advertising.
