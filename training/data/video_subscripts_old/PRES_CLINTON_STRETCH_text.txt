People are working harder than ever but the everyday cost of prescriptions childcare or even 
"just buying groceries can be a stretch for too many families. Hillary's plan, raise the minimum "
"wage get equal, pay for women, cut taxes for the middle class, and new incentives for business "
"to share profits with employees, instead of just rewarding CEOs. Those at the top are doing "
just fine. It's your family that needs a raise. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message. 
Smith.
