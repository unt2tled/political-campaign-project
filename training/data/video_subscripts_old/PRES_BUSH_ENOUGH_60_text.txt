Just one other thing.
I got to get this off.
My chest.
Donald Trump is a jerk.
Donald Trump facing new
criticism for something.
He did on the campaign Trail
last night in South Carolina.
He appeared to Ma so reporter
it with a disability.
So you got to see this guy.
I don't know what I said.
I don't remember.
I have a 12 year old sons and
Italia cerebral palsy and that
just made me so angry.
"I told my wife, I just couldn't"
let that stand.
I had to do something.
Make sure Donald Trump wasn't
nominee for the Republican
"party, I believe."
Life is precious.
I think life is truly a gift
from God and we're all equal
under God's watchful eye.
That's what I believe.
"And when anybody, anybody"
disparages people with
"disabilities,"
it sets me off.
That's why I called him a jerk.
What kind of person would you
want to have in the presidency
that does that what point do we
"say, enough of this?"
Let's start solving problems.
I'm Jeb Bush and I approve this
message.
Yes.
