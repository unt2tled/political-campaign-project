Increases endless new
"regulations, 8 trillion dollars"
borrowed and spent.
We need to take power out of
Washington and give it back to
the American people.

"business climate, no one can"

My plan will create a 19
million new jobs.
The American dream will be
"possible for Millions, who have"
forgotten what it looks like.
We will compete with the world
and we will win.
I'm Jeb Bush and I approve this
message.
