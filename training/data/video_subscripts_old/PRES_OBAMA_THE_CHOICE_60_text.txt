"Over the next four months, you have a choice to make, not just between two political parties "

"And he says that if we do, our economy will grow and everyone will benefit. But you know what? "

"in education, manufacturing and homegrown. American energy, for example, good middle class "
"jobs. Sometimes politics can seem very small, but the choice you face, it couldn't be bigger. "
"I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.  "
