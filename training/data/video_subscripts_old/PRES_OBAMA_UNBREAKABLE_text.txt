"When I went to Israel, I saw families. There who showed me where missiles would come down near "
"their children's bedrooms, and I was reminded of what that would mean. If those were my kids. "
"I went to Yad vashem, the Holocaust Museum there to remind myself that the nature of evil and "
"why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable. As long as I'm president, United States. Iran "
will not get a nuclear weapon. I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.
