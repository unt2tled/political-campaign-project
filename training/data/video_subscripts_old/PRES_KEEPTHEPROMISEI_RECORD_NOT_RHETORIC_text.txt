"Hi, everyone. Here talks about the need to take on Washington. The natural. Next question is "
who actually has done. So he actually went to Washington DC and did what he told the voters he 
"was going to do. Who actually has stood up, not just a Democrat but two leaders in our own heart. "
"60 was guys, doesn't apologize. What he has to say. Why do I support Ted? Cruz is because I trust "
Ted Cruz when I tell you I'm going to do. So I'm going to do exactly what I said. I would do. Keep 
the promise. One is responsible for the content of this advertising.
