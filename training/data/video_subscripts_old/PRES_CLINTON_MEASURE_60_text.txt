"How tall are you? How do we measure greatness in America? The height of our skyscrapers, the "
"size of our bank accounts? No, it's measured by what we do for our children, the values we pass "
on. I've spent my life fighting for kids and families and it'll be my mission to build a country 
where our children can rise as high as their dreams and hard work takes them. That means good 
schools. For every child in every zip code college that leads to Opportunities not debt and 
an economy where every Young American can find a job that lets them start a family of their own. 
"We face big challenges, but we can solve them the same way. Families do working together respecting "
one another and never giving up. I want our success is to be measured by. There's I'm Hillary 
Clinton and I approve this message.
