My father's family business was hired to work. Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. We were thrilled 
"back. Then, you thought you got a job with Donald Trump, you're golden when the payment was late. "
We were assured that the money's on its way. Don't worry. It's coming. It never came. Mr. Trump 
owed us two hundred and thirty two thousand dollars. We were small family company. We couldn't 
withstand that kind of hit. It. Nearly put us out of business. My dad had to lay off his own brother. 
It was devastating. When you hear Donald Trump talked about the fact that he's out to help the 
little guy. It's a complete falsehood. You look at his track record over the years people like 
us that he stole money from. We're the little guys that he's talking about. He's been far worse 
than anything. He's saying he's going to protect us again. I made a lot of money in Atlantic City 
and I'm very proud of him hurting the little people that's where he made. All of his money smells 
responsible for the content  
of this advertising. Ew.
