This epidemic of gun. Violence knows no boundaries between 88 and 92. People. A day are killed 
by guns. We're better than this. We need to close the loopholes and support Universal background 
checks. How many people have to die before we actually act before we come together as a nation 
on the resentment and I approve this message. Yes.
