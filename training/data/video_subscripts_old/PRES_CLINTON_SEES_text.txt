I first met Hillary Clinton when I was 9 years old and I can tell when she looked at me. She didn't 
see disability. She saw someone strong and capable. Like I see myself. Donald Trump doesn't 
see people like me. He just sees disability. I honestly feel bad for someone with so much hate 
in his heart. We need a president who sees the best in all of us. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve 
this message.
