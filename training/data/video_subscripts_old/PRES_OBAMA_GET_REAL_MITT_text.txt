I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message. Mitt Romney on how to pay for College and start a 
business. Take a risk. Get the Education Borrow money if you have to for your parents. Hope they 
can afford it. Romney's plans could cut College aid for nearly 10 million students and eliminate 
the tax deduction for College tuition. President Obama eliminated bank middlemen from College 
loans and use the savings to double College grants. Take a risk. Get the Education Borrow money 
if you have to for your parents. Get riot.
