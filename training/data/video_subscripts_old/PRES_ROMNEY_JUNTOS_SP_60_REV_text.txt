I want to share with you why I want to be your President. I believe in the promise of America that 
"with hard work, anything is possible regardless of where we come from. But in the last four years, "
"we've seen that promise fade away. Today, Hispanics are hurting with so many unemployed, and "
those who are working are having to do more with less. Families are struggling to save their 
homes and businesses. They've been forced to use their hard earned savings to pay bills. Can 
we endure four more years of this poor economy? You deserve better. For the sake of our children 
"and grandchildren, we must do better. I know how to revive the American dream. I will not let "
"you down. I will work tirelessly to create more good paying jobs, to reform the education system, "
and to lower taxes. Kuntos. We can revive the American dream. So I met Romney. Yep. Estimates. 
Ahe.
