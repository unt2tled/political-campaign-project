Look no further than the Syrian
border to see that the obama-
clinton policies have failed.
Millions flee their Homeland
"because she talked to us, but"
did nothing to protect them.
Syria is in shambles.
Iraq is swinging.
Isis is creating its own
country.
Iran is building a bomb.
Israel is abandoned.
I came here to see it for
myself.
"What I saw is failure, failure"
to protect America failure to
protect our friends and failure
to protect the innocent.
"I'm Ben Carson, and I approve"
