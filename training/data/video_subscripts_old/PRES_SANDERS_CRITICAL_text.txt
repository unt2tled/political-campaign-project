A woman's right to control her home. Health care is something that's very important to me. The 
very first conversation that I had with Bernie Sanders was on this issue. Bernie has spent his 
entire career defending a woman's right to choose. I'm the mother of two daughters. This is 
critical to me. I would not be standing behind Bernie Sanders. If he didn't have 100% record 
on a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. This is a deal-breaker and he is a champion 
for a woman's right to choose. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
