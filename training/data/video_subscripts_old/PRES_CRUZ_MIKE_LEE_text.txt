Here today to announce my endorsement of Ted Cruz. I've decided to endorse Ted for a number of 
reasons. He promised that he would stand up to a growing overbearing federal government. He 
promised that he would fight against Obamacare. He promised he would resist efforts to undermine 
our Second Amendment rights of Americans. He promised that he would oppose any efforts to undermine 
religious liberty. Ted has kept those promises with that. Trust that he's earned. We need to 
unite behind Ted Cruz. I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message.
