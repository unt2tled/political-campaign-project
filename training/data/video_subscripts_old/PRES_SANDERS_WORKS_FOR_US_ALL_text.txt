You're doing everything right but find it harder and harder to get by. You're not alone while 
people work longer hours for low wages. Almost all new income goes to the top 1%. My plan make 
Wall Street banks in the ultra Rich. Pay their fair share of Packers provide living wages for 
working. People ensure equal pay for women. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message because 
together we can make a political revolution in create an economy and democracy. That works 
"for all, not just the council.  "
