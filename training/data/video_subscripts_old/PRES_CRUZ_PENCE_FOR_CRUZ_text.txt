This is a time for choosing. All of America is is looking to Indiana to make a choice. I'm a Reagan 
conservative. I see Ted Cruz has a principled conservative who's dedicated his career to advocating 
"the Reagan. Agenda. I really admire the way Ted Cruz has been willing to stand up for taxpayers, "
"in opposing runaway spending deficits and debt calling foreign leading on repealing, Obamacare. "
I will be voting for Ted Cruz. I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message. Zh.
