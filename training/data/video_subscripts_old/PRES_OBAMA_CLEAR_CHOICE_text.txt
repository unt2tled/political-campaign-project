This election to me is about which candidate is more likely to return us the Full Employment. 
This is a Clear Choice. The Republican plan is to cut more taxes on upper income people and go 
back to deregulation. That's what got us in trouble in the first place. President Obama has 
"a plan to rebuild America from the ground up, investing in Innovation, education and job training. "
It only works. If there is a strong middle class. That's what happened when I was President. 
We need to keep going with his plan. I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.
