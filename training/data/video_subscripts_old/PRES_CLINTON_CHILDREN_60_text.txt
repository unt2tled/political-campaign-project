One of the areas that
I've been particularly
interested in is the area of
children.
"To each other, we intend to be"
sure that everybody in this
room and every child in this
"state, is somebody no matter"
where they're born.
No matter to whom they are
born.
Our children's future is shaped
both by the values of their
parents and the policies of
their Nation.
It's time to protect the Next
Generation.
Fill the lives of our children
with possibility and hope open
up the doors.
So that Every child has a
chance to live up to his or her
god-given potential.
I've spent my life fighting for
"children families, and our"
"country, and I'm not stopping."
Now.
"I'm Hillary Clinton, and I've"
always approve this message.
