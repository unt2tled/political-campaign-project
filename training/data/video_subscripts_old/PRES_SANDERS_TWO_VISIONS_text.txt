"There are two Democratic Visions for regulating Wall Street. One says, it's okay to take Millions "
"from Big Banks and then tell them what to do. My plan break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes "
and make them pay their fair share. Then we can expand Health Care to all and provide Universal 
"college education. Will they like me? No, will they begin to play by the rules of on President? "
You better believe it? I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message. H.
