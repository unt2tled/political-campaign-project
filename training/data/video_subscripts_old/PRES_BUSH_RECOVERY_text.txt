"Today, I was at a summit"
dealing with this heroin
"epidemic, and this is a huge"
problem.
It's not just heroin.
"It's drug addiction in general,"
and I have personal experience
in this as a dad.
My daughter Noelle
was addicted to drugs
and it was tough.
It was really hard.
"There is a solution to this,"
but it requires leadership.
Do you want someone?
That can figure out how to
solve a problem.
That passionately goes about
the business of fixing these
"things,"
then I'm your guy.
I'm Jeb Bush and I approve this
message.
