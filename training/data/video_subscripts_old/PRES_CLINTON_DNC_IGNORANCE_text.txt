Under President Bush and Obama.
I fought the Taliban.
I was asked to for Global
coalition to counter isil.
When someone makes the comment
that they know more about the
Islamic State or isil then to
the generals.
It implies a complete ignorance
"of the reality, but I believe"
secretary Clinton really
understands the threat that the
Islamic State poses to the
United States and the American
people.
And I believe she understands
how to wield American power to
ultimately defeat this threaded
to keep us safe.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I
approve this message.
