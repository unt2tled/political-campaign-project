"North Carolina's furniture and textile Industries, decimated by Decades of disastrous trade "
"deals over three hundred and sixty one thousand manufacturing jobs. Lost, only one candidate "
for president has opposed every disastrous deal Bernie Sanders while. His opponent has flip-flopped 
on trade deals. Bernie has bought them and stood with American workers. He'll take on Wall Street 
and their trade deals because he doesn't take their money for jobs for us. Bernie. I'm Bernie 
Sanders and I approve this message. Sir.
