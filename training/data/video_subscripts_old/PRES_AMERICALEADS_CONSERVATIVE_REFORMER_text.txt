"In New Jersey, as Governor,"
I've stood up against economic
Calamity and unprecedented
natural disaster.
We balance 6 budgets in a row.
We've refused to raise taxes.
We made the difficult decisions
"to reform, pensions that reform"
10-year.
I proven that you can stand up
"and fight the most powerful,"
special interests and stop
them.
That fight has not made me more
weary.
It has made me stronger and I
am now ready to fight for the
people of the United States of
America.
Their Collegiate responsible
"for country, was that"
