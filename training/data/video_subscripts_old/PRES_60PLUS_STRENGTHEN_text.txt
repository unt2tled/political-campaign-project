to know who to trust the facts. Medicare is going bankrupt. President. Obama hasn't done much 
to fix it. He took seven hundred billion dollars from Medicare to pay for his Healthcare law 
"Mitt Romney will strengthen Medicare. So it's there for seniors and our grandkids, no changes. "
"For those over 55 younger, folks can choose the care that's best for them. Strengthen Medicare "
"vote for Romney 60 plus Association, is responsible for the content of this advertising.  "
