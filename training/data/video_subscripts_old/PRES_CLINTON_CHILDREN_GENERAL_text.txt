One of the areas that I've been
particularly interested in is
"the area of children, went and"
did he sure that everybody in
this room?
Anybody no matter where they're
"born, no matter to whom they"
are born.
I want to say sure that every
child has a chance to live up
to his or her god-given
potential.
I've spent my life fighting for
"children, and I'm not stopping."
Now.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I've
always appreciated.
