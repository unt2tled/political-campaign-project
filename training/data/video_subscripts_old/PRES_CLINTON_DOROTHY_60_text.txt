"When I think about why I'm doing this, I think about my mother Dorothy. She was abandoned by her "
"parents, at the age of eight sent from Chicago to LA to live with grandparents, who didn't want "
"her, but people showed her kindness, gave her a chance like, the teacher who saw my mother had "
"no money for food. And started bringing her extra from home Whispering. You know, Dorothy. "
I just brought too much food today. She went to work in somebody else's home at age 40. Teen and 
it opened her eyes for the first time. She saw parents who loved and cared for their children. 
And that's the kind of Loving Family. She provided for us when she needed a champion. Someone 
"was there, I think about all the doors. He's all over America who fight for their families, who "
"never give up. That's why I'm doing this. That's why I've always done this for all the dorsey's, "
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
