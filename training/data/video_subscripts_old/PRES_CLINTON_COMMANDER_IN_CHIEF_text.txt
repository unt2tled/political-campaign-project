America is not just electing a
president.
We're also electing a commander
"in chief, that choice matters"
because strengthening the
"economy making health care,"
"more affordable, raising"
income.
All of that depends on us.
Being both secure at home and
leading the world.
I will get up every single day
and do whatever it takes to
make.
Sure our country is safe and
strong.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I
approve this message.
