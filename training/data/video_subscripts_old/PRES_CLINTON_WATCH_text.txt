"Our children, watch everything we do and the person we elect as president has the power to shape "
"their lives. For years to come, Hillary has spent her entire career bringing folks together "
"on behalf of our kids because she believes that every child deserves a chance to succeed, Hillary "
will be a president or kids can look up to a president who believes in our kids and will fight for 
them every day. That's why I believe in her. I hope you'll join me. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve 
this message.
