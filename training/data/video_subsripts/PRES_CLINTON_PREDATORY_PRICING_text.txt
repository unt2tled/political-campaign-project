This is a letter from someone who's here. She has to take a brand-name drugs and taking it. Since 
"the early 1980s at that time, it cost approximately $180 for ten shots. The latest refill was "
fourteen thousand seven hundred dollars for the same 10 vial and the company is called valeant 
Pharmaceuticals. I'm going after them. This is predatory pricing and we're going to make sure 
it is stopped and I approve this message.
