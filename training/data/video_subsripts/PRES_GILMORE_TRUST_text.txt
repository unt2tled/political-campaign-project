Obama and Clinton just don't get it. These are radical Islamic terrorists. We can't trust our 
safety to Washington politicians or inexperienced amateurs. I was in Army intelligence chairman 
of a terrorism commissioned that warned of an attack before 9/11 and Governor during 9/11. 
I'm not a Washington politician or an amateur as president. I will defeat Isis and keep you safe. 
I'm Jim Gilmore and I authorized this mess. See.
