This is not an ordinary time.
And this is not an ordinary
election.
I want to send a message to
"every boy and girl, and indeed"
to the entire world that
"America already is great, but"
we are great because we are
good.
We are going to lift each other
up.
I want us to heal our country
and bring it together.
We have to start getting the
economy to work for everyone.
Not just those at the top
making the Best education
system from preschool through
"college, making it affordable"
because that's I think the best
way for us to get the future
that our children and our
grandchildren deserve.
My vision of America is an
America where
everyone has a place.
This is the America that I know
and love if we set those goals
and we go together.
There's nothing that if
I'm Hillary Clinton
