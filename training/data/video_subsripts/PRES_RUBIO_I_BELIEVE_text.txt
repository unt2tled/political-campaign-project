I'm Marco Rubio and I approved this message. I believe that if we can lead this country if we can 
embrace the opportunities of this new era if we can confront its challenges and harness its 
"promise. I believe, with all my heart that you and I will go down in history as the generation "
that ushered in a New American Century and we will be able to say that we left for our children. 
"And for our grandchildren, what our parents left for us, the single greatest nation in the history "
of all mankind.
