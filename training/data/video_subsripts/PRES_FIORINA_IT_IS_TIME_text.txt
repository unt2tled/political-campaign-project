Throughout my life. I have been told by many people. Don't challenge the status quo. Just sit 
down and be quiet. Don't Rock the Boat. Just accept that. This is the way things are. We don't 
care for our veterans. We are crushing small businesses. We don't secure our borders. We don't 
keep our nation safe. That is why I'm running for president. It is time to take our country back.
