"The NAFTA trade, treaty 850,000 jobs. Lost special. Trade status with China, three million "
jobs lost. Now the trans-pacific trade deal could cost America four hundred and forty eight 
thousand more jobs. Only one candidate for president has opposed every disastrous deal Bernie 
Sanders. While others supported unfair trade deals. Bernie stood with American workers. 
He'll take on Wall Street and their trade deals because he doesn't take their money for jobs 
for us. Bernie. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
