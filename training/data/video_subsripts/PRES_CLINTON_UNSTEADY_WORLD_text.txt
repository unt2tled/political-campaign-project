An unsteady world will be in one person's hand. Wouldn't you rather in a certain sense? Have

more nuclear weapons. Hillary Clinton knows that the last thing we need as Secretary of State. 
She negotiated a reduction in nuclear weapons with Russia and work with both parties to get 
"it passed. An unsteady World demands, a very steady leader. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve "
this message. Age.
