Top accomplishment that made
you decide to endorse him?
I guess it's hard to say their
accomplishments and I'll ask
you one more time list.
"One, accomplishment that Marco"
Rubio is achieved in four years

in Florida.
Marco.
Rubio finished the sentence.
"Well, I mean, I would just say"
that this is the guy who's been
able to.
"Number one,"
bottom line is he didn't get
accomplishments done.
He was a President Obama
you You do two billion dollars
in spending cut taxes by
nineteen billion dollars 1.3
"million jobs, 4.4 percent"
"growth, 8 balanced budgets."
"That is a conservative record,"
"was a reform-minded,"
conservative.
I did cut taxes every year at
balanced budgets.
Every year when I left there
were nine billion dollars in
reserves.
We reduce the state government
"Workforce by 13,000, in my"
record of government.
I think shows the path of what
could happen in Washington.
D.c.
I'm Jeb Bush and I approve this
message.
