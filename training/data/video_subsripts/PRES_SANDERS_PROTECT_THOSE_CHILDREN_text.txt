"I have four kids. We have seven, very beautiful grandchildren. Can you imagine being a mother "
"seeing your own child's intellectual development deteriorate in front of your very eyes, "
"if the local government cannot protect those children, if the state government cannot protect "
those children than the federal government better get in. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve 
this message.
