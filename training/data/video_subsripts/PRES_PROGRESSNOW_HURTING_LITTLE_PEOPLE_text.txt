We were hired in 1989 to work at the Taj Mahal. We were thrilled back. Then you thought you got 
"a job with Donald Trump, you golden, when the payment was late. We were assured that the money's "
"on its way. Don't worry. It's coming, it never came. Mr. Trump owed us two hundred and thirty "
two thousand dollars. It nearly put us out of business. It was devastating. I made a lot of money 
in Atlantic City and I'm very proud of it. Hurting the little people that's where he made all 
of his money.
