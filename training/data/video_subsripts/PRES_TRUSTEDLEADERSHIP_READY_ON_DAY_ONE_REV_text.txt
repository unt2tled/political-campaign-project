"Lots of candidates say, they'll stand up to the party bosses and political ruling class. But "
"one candidate has done it. That's why conservatives across the country, put their trust in "

the terrorists and protect our homeland. The time for Big Talk has passed Ted. Cruz is trusted 
and proven ready to lead on day one trusted leadership responsible for the content of this effort. 
Sighs.
