I ran for office because no matter which party is in power government and debt continued to grow 
as president. I'll make government smaller by cutting spending and taxes. My flat tax eliminate 
"the 70,000 page tax code and the IRS to take back America. I'll fight for term limits for everybody. "
I'll insist Congress read the bills before they vote. I'm Rand Paul. And I approve this message 
because America needs a real.
