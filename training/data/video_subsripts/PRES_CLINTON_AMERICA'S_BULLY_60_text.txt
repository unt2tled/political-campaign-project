"Sit down,"
sit down.
I'd look her right in that fat
ugly face of hers.
She ate like a pig.
Tell me a little bit more about
why?
That's on your mind.
I have asthma and occasionally.
I've heard people talking
behind my back.
That was really Brave.
I really do think we need more
love and kindness in our
country.
That's why it's important to
stand up to bullies wherever
they are and why we shouldn't
let anybody bully his way into
"the presidency, because that is"
not who we are as Americans.
And I approve this message.
