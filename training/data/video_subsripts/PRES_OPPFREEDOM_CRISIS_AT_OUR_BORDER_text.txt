When there was a crisis in our border last year and the president refused my invitation to see 
that challenge. I told him mr. President. If you do not secure this border Texas will because 
of that threat that was posed by those drug cartels. I deployed the Texas National Guard. If 
you elect me your president. I will secure that border.
