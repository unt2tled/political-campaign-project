I'm not going home without
my parents
or deportation.
I'm scared for them because
"others, it would take to"
extremely
nervous.
Everything.
I've killed.
You don't have to be scared.
We don't have to worry about
what happened.
I
feel really strongly that
you've been very brave
and you have to be brave for
them to.
They want you to be happy.
They want you to be successful.
They don't want you to worry
too much.
Let me do the worrying.
I'll do all the worrying that a
deal.
I'll do the worry.
I'll do everything.
I can to help.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I
approve.
