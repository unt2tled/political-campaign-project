Chicago. We have endured a corrupt political system and the chief politician standing in the 
way of us getting good. Schools is our man. If you have a presidential candidate that supports 
someone like army or you have a candidate who's not willing to take on the establishment. Bernie 
Sanders is definitely not afraid to take on the system head. He looks beyond that system and 
sees better possibilities for us. He sees that this is not the way it has to be. That is why I support 
Bernie Sanders. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
