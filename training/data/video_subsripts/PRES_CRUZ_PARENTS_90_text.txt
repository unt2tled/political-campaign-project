that I had told head over and over again that this is the land of opportunity. This is a land where 
"with hard work and perseverance. All your dreams can become reality, heads relationship with "
his father is one of inspiration. Al has inspired Ted all his life to be a freedom fighter to appreciate 
and value. The dream that is America. We had left high school. He was passionate about the Constitution. 
He was passionate about free markets about the rule of law about limited government. And let 
me tell you that reason. I know that Ted will continue to follow that path. Is that that fire? 
"He starts alive today as it was 30 years ago, provided my family with hope here, my mom became "
"the first in our family, ever to go to college here. My dad, fled Cuba and wash dishes making fifty "
"cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas when I ran for Senate, I promise 27 "
million Texans. I was fight  
for you every day and not for the Washington bosses and as president. I will do the same. I'm Ted 
Cruz and I approve this message.
