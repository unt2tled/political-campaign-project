Going back to the old neighborhood. Can be hard sometimes for too many kids. It feels like your 
"ZIP code, determines your life and it Bernie Sanders. We have a candidate who says, we can do "
better. This campaign is ultimately about opportunity like that. Every Public University 
"would be tuition free. It's about rebuilding our country, our community because we see in Bernie "
"Sanders, a man to support those values who will fight for our families and you can win next week. "
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
