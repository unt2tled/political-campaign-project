"You got people working incredibly long hours median, family income today, for thousand dollars, "
less than it was in 1999. The bottom line of this economy is that it is rigged. What this campaign 
is about is to demand that we create an economy that works for all of us rather than a handful of 
billionaires. If you work 40 hours a week in America. You should not live in poverty. I'm Bernie 
Sanders and I approve this message.
