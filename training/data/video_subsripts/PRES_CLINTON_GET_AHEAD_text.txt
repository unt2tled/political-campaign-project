"If you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. But the Republicans, "
"they want to go back to letting the super-wealthy call the shots. They don't stand up for equal, "
"pay for women. They don't support Paid Family, Leave. They don't even really support refinancing "
student debt. We've got to get this economy working for the vast majority of Americans. Not 
just for those at the top. That's what I intend to do as president. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve 
this message.
