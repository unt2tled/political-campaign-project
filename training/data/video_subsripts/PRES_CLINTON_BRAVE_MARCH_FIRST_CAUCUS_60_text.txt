"My parents, they have a new"
of different patients.
I'm scared for them because
public it would take to unscrew
that.
"I was everything I can to, you"
don't have to be scared
so you don't have to worry
about
what happens.
"Somebody else, your family"
"still really, really strongly"
that you're being very brave
and you have to be brave to
them too.
They want you to be happy.
They want you to be successful.
They don't want you to worry
too much.
Let me do the worrying.
I'll do all the worrying that a
deal.
I'll do the worry.
I'll do everything.
I can to help.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I
approve this message.
