"There are those who say we cannot defeat a corrupt political system and fix a rigged economy, "
but I believe we need to lift our vision above the obstacles in place and look to the American 
Horizon to a nation where every child can not only dream of going to college. But attend one where 
"Quality Health Care will be a Birthright of every citizen. We're a good job, is not a wish, but "
a reality where women receive equal pay and a living wage is I paid to all and America were after 
"a lifetime of Labor. There is time for rest and grandchildren, a nation that defends our people "
"and our Founders, but no longer carries so much of that burden alone. I know we can create that "
America if we listen to our conscience and our heart and not to the pundits and the naysayers. 
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message and I ask for your vote.
