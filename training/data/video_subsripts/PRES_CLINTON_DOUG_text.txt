"I cast my first vote for president as a college kid, at the University of Iowa. I voted Republican "
"then and I have ever since but I cannot vote for Donald Trump when I see him, bullying people trying "
"to divide us. That's not the kind of country. I want my kids to grow up in, so I'm putting party "
aside and voting for Hillary Clinton. I don't agree with Hillary on everything that I know. 
She has the judgment and the experience and she knows you need to bring people together to get 
things done. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message. Yeah.
