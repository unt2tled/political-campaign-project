The world of president has to Grapple with. Sometimes you can't even imagine. That's the job 
and she's the one who's proven. She can get it. Done. Securing a massive reduction in nuclear

health care for 8 million children. No wonder President Obama called celery and extraordinarily 
experienced L making a difference to people in their day-to-day lives. I'm Hillary Clinton 
and I approve this.
