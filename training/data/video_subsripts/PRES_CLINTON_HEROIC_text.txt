My wedding was one of the last things I planned with my mom. It was a very Bittersweet day. My mom 
was the principal of Sandy Hook school. She was murdered trying to protect the children in her 
"care from the gunman. No one is fighting harder to reform, our gun laws, then Hillary Clinton. "
She is the only candidate that has what it takes to take on the gun lobby. She reminds me of my mother. 
She isn't scared of anything. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
