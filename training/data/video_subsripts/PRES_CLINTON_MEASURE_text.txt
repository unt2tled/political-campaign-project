How do we measure greatness in America? Its measured by what we do for our children. It's why 
"as president, I'll invest in our schools and college that leads to Opportunities not debt and "
an economy where every Young American can find a job that lets them start a family of their own. 
I've spent my life fighting for kids and families. I want our success to be measured by bears. 
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
