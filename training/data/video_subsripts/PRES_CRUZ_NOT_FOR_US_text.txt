I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message. Right before John Kasich was governor. He collected 
"six hundred and eleven thousand dollars from a Fortune, 500 Corporation after Kasich, became "
Governor that same company received 619 Grand in state tax breaks for job creation. But last 
year the company laid off 100 Ohioans even as its CEO cut a half million dollar check to Kasich 
Super PAC John kasich's not for us.
