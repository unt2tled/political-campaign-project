"Has anyone else here struggled with being lied to? Well, I voted for a guy who was a tea party here "
on the campaign Trail when he went to DC and play pattycake with Chuck Schumer and could deal 
on amnesty. Does that make you angry? Angry makes me feel dumb from trust in them? Maybe you should 
vote for more than just a pretty face. Next time. Is that room for one more? Come on in. Come on 
in. I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message.
