My mom was my best friend. She was the principal of Sandy Hook School. My mom was murdered while 
trying to protect the children in her care from a gunman. No more family should have to go through 
what we have. Hillary Clinton is the only candidate that has what it takes to take on the gun lobby. 
"No one is fighting harder to reform, our gun laws. Then Hillary, she reminds me of my mother. "
She isn't scared of anything. And that's how I know that she is the person that can actually Really 
make a difference. That's why I believe in her. That's why I millions of other Americans believe 
in her. There's finally someone who can change things. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this 
message.
