The American people can't
afford to wait for ideas that
"sound good on paper, but we'll"
never make it in the real
world.
"The grandmother, who has to"
choose between paying for
medicine and paying rent.
"Can't wait, the single mom who"
desperately needs a raise.
Can't wait the student with a
mountain of death.
Can't wait.
We can make real progress right
now.
"I'm positing, I'm talking, I'm"
talking to Hillary Clinton.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I
approve this message.
Age.
