"works for everyone. Not just those at the top, an economy that creates jobs families can really "
live on to work with our allies around the world and keep our families safe at home to give every 
man woman and child. The chance to live up to their god-given potential. What kind of America 
do we want to be dangerously divided or strong and United. I believe we are always stronger together. 
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message. Message.
