I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message between sips of wine and bites of salad. A Planned Parenthood 
"doctor discusses getting money for tissue from aborted, fetuses harvesting the organs of "
"aborted. Fetuses for money Planned, Parenthood treats, The Unborn like another form of currency "
and yet some politicians still defend them Planned. Parenthood serves a good function with 
the debt. We have. Should we even give them a penny? We have to look at the positives. Donald Trump 
is just plain. I'm wrong.
