There's a lot to do on a dairy farm. Nobody's going to do it for you. Have to get out there and do 
it yourself. Bernie Sanders is a well-known friend of Family Farms. Bernie cannot be bought 
out by Big Money. Bernie's opinion. Cannot be purchased. It's time for our next president to 
"get in there. Roll up. His sleeves, take off the gloves and take on Wall Street. They take on big "
"business, take on big money and get the working-class back to where they should be. He's a rock. "
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message. Ouch.
