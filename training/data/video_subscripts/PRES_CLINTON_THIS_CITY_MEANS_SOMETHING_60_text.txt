Have fun has no fresh clean water source. The water is poisoned. We can't drink the water. We 
can't bathe in the water. You can't cook with the water. There was a time when we were alone and 
"nobody heard our story. I am here because for nearly two years, Flint's water was poisoned. "
"Hillary Clinton came here to show this, he standing with us. She's the one that brought this "
"to another level of attention. That's what we needed, and what had been happening. Happening "
"in Flint had happened in Grosse, Pointe, or bloke tail Hills. I think we all know we would have "
had a solution yesterday. Hillary Clinton really cares about people. She's awesome. When 
you have somebody like that fighting for you and supporting you and saying I've got your back 
"Kenneth for much more and I will fight for you in Flint. No matter how long is,  "
I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message. Hey.
