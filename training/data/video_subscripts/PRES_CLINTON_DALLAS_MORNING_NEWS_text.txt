The Dallas Morning News is
recommended.
Hillary Clinton for president.
This newspaper is not
recommended to Democrat for the
nation's highest office.
Since before World War Two

"exhibits, a dangerous lack of"
judgment
on Capitol Hill.

Republicans for working across
the aisle.
She deserves your vote at this
moment in time for Texas and
