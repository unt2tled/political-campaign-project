I served under President Bush and Obama. I fought the Taliban. I was asked to form a global coalition 
to counter isil. When someone makes the comment that they know more about the Islamic State 
"or isil then to the generals. It implies a complete ignorance of the reality, but I believe secretary "
Clinton really understands the threat that the Islamic State poses to the United States and 
to the American people. And I believe she understands how to wield American power to ultimately 
defeat this threat. And to keep us safe. I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
