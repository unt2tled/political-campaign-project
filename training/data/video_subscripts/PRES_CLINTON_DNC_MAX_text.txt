"So when I saw that, that was"
completely disqualifying.
I'm a republican.
But this election is so much
bigger than party.
"My son, Max can't live in Trump"
World.
So I'm crossing party lines and
voting for Hillary.
I don't always agree with her
but she's reasonable and she's
smart.
She can work with people to
solve problems.
I want to be able to tell my
kids that I did the right
thing.
When it really mattered.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I
"approve this message Yahoo, and"
get the shows you love.
