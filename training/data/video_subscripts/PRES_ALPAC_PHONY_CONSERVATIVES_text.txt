Phony conservatives exposed the
"latest Ted Cruz, Cruz talks a"
"big game, but when the rubber"
"meets the road, we can't trust"
him first.
He votes to borrow billions and
"bust the budget, then skips The"
"crucial vote, to audit, the"
Federal Reserve.
Thank goodness for Rand Paul
"Rands leading, the fight to cut"
"spending to balance, the budget"
audit the fed.
He's the only true fiscal
conservative.
We can trust Rand Paul for
president.
