I'm Hillary Clinton and I
approve this message.
What does showing up when it's
"time to vote actually mean,"
you care about protecting his
legacy
"and our progress,"
you care about moving forward
United as one
because when we show up in full
"force, and when we refuse to"
"stand by quietly, we show what"
it means to be stronger
together.
