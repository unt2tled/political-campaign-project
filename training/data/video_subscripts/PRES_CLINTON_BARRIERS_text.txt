I believe in building ladders
of opportunity for people
knocking down the barriers.
"That stand in the way, Hillary"
knows education is the way up
to a good job.
A decent living.
So she wants preschool for
every child great teachers and
college.
Without crushing debt.
Together.
We can break down barriers for
our kids.
So they get the education.
"They need, and"
"no matter what ZIP code, they"
"live in, I'm Hillary Clinton"
and I approve this message.
George.
