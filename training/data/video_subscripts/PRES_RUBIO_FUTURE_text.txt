America can't afford four more years like the last date. That's why I'm endorsing Marco Rubio 
for president as the wife of a combat veteran. I know Marco will keep America safe. And as your 
"Governor, I trust Marco to bring a conscience to Republicans in Washington and reign in our "
out-of-control federal government. I'm Nikki Haley. I'm endorsing Marco because this election 
"is about the future and the future is now, I'm Marco Rubio, and I approved this message. Zh.  "
