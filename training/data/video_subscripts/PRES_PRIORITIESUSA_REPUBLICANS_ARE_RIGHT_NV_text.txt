This is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter. I don't know what I said. Good tribute 
to the reporters questions to her menstrual cycle. Blood coming out of her wherever I haven't 
endorsed. Mr. Trump. Frankly. I made a commitment like a pig. Let's be very very clear. I do not 
support Trump. Donald Trump has created a toxic atmosphere. He's a Mexican claiming a person. 
"Can't do the job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist, comment "
priorities. USA action is responsible.
