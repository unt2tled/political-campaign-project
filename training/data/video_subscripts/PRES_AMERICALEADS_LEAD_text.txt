Isis is gaining strength to
"the, we have containment to"
"the, we have containment."
You cannot be an American fight
this President and Hillary
Clinton date.
America weaker and more
vulnerable.
America is tired of weakness in
the Oval Office.
We better not turn it over to
his second mate.
Hillary Clinton.
We have to stop worrying about
being loved and start caring
about being respected.
Again.
We need to have strength and
Authority back of the Oval
Office.
That's what America needs right
now.
