"Even when the deck is stacked, a New Yorker will find a way to break up. Big Banks create millions "
"of jobs and rebuild America. Some say, it can't be done again. But another Native Son of New York "

"every child a chance, New York. It's our time again, to build a future to believe in. I'm Bernie "
Sanders and I approve.
