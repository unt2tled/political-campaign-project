I'm Gary Johnson candidate for president of the United States. And I approve this message. 
"I'm Governor, Gary Johnson. I'm Governor Bill. Weld. I'm running for president. I'm running "
with them.  
"As the governor of New Mexico, I vetoed wasteful spending, 750 times, cut taxes 14 times, unless "
"the state with new highways Bridges schools, hospitals, and a billion dollar Surplus without "
raising taxes. A panic as governor of Massachusetts. I cut taxes 21 times and took unemployment 
"from the highest rate among the 11, industrialized states to the lowest and he did that in his "
first term. It was easy difference between the two of us and the other candidates running for 
president is too. We've been there and done that. Give us one term America and it's after 4 years 
you decide you don't like peace prosperity and freedom. You can always vote a trump or Hillary 
back into office. Again. Duncan Wells 2016. Our best America yet. What the America you in come?
