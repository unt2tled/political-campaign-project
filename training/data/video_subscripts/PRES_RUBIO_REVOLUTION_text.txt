"36 years ago, this nation faced a period of Doubt, after a failed presidency. It felt like America "
was in Decline. Our economy was stagnant and the American dream. We felt like it was slipping 
"away. And then we elected a president that inspired us, who asked us to remember who we were and "
"who believed as we do that, America's greatest days. Always lie ahead. Well, now, the children "
of the Reagan Revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadership.
