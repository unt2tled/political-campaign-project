"This is everything that I have my family. Alyssa, she's six years old recently. She just wanted "
"to borrow the parts. She asked me, did Rosa Park, not give up her seat for a white man. And I say "
"yes, and I had to explain to her that it's not really over. This is what Mommy is my actor. This "
"and the same thing. Martin Luther, King was he fought for our rights? This is the same thing. "
I was doing and honor of her pop pop. My dad's name is Eric Garner. I was able to see my dad died on 
national TV. They don't know what they took from us. I'm just trying to get the truth out there. 
"He was being a loving caring, man that he was and he was learning. For a whole year has protested. "
I feel like a representative because I'm doing this. I'm speaking out me being his daughter. 
I'm never giving up. I'm never going to forget what happened to my dad. Our people died for this. 
Martin Luther King died for this. I'm behind anymore. Who's going to listen and speak up for 
her.  
I think we need to believe in only the Like Bernie Sanders. It is not acceptable to me that we have 
"seen young, black men be beaten and be killed unjustly. People are dying. This is real. This "
is not TV. We need a president that's going to talk about it. I want to see an America where when 
young black men walk down the street. They will not be harassed by police officers. They will 
not be killed. They will not be shot. That's why I'm for Bernie. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve 
this message.
