The idea of America is slipping
away right in front of us
eighteen trillion dollars of
debt.
Our Supreme Court that things
are smarter than God Obamacare
when we can't afford the
"government yacht, if you're"
looking to elect somebody who's
going to manage the slow
decline of this once.
Great country
go vote for somebody else.
I want my last breath with
every ounce of energy and
blood.
I've got fight as hard as I can
to rescue the idea of Americans
believe again is constituted.
