AARP is taking on the issues important to you and your  
family in Cincinnati.  
We're urging the presidential candidates to give us details  
on how they plan to update social security for the future.  
We want to know how their plan will affect us.  
"How much it will cost and how they'll get it done and prove,  "
they care about the future of all Ohioans.
