My family's lived on this farm for three generations. The Bakken pipeline would pump dirty 
crude oil across Iowa. The fact that Bernie Sanders stands up against the pipeline is one of 
"the reasons we support him. Bernie Sanders didn't hesitate to say no to the big oil companies, "
"Perino's that if we don't act, we threaten the climate and the health of our children, Bernie "
Sanders understands that very Sanders has the guts to just stand up for what he believes in. 
I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message. H.
