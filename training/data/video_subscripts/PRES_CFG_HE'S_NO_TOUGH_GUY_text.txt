Donald Trump talks tough about
"China and Mexico,"
but who has Trump ever actually
taken on?
He hides behind bankruptcy laws
to duck paying his bills and
kill American jobs.
He even tried to kick an
elderly Widow out of her home
through eminent domain.
Real tough guy.
Trump picks on workers and
widows.
He won't do a thing to China
and Mexico
