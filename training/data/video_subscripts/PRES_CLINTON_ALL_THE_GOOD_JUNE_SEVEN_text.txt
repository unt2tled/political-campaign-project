I'm Hillary Clinton and I
approve this message.
Her life's work has been about
breaking barriers
and so would her presidency.
Which is why I thought every
"American who's not being paid,"
"what they're worth, who's held"
"back by student debt, or a"
system tilted against them.
And there are far too many of
you.
She understands that our
country can't reach his
potential
unless we all do
together
a stronger country.
