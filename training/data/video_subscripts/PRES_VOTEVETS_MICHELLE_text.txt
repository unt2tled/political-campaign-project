"David was proud to be an American Soldier. And I know I'm prejudiced, because he was my son, but "
I don't think he had a mean bone in his body. There is not a day that I don't think about David. When 
"I saw Donald Trump attack, another gold star mother. I felt such a sense of outrage. She was standing "
there. She had nothing to say. She probably startled. Trump cannot respect the gold star family. 
Then why would anyone in America think he would respect them vote? That's is responsible for 
the content of this advertising. I see.
