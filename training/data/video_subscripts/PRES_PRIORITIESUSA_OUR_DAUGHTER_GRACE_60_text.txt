I remember being in the ultrasound room and finding out that our daughter was going to be born 
with a disability and spina bifida. We came home. And the first thing I could think to do was to 
"open up the Bible and the first, it jumped out on the page was John 14:27 where Jesus says, do not "
"let your hearts be troubled, and do not be afraid, and we decided to name her Grace. Grace is an "
absolute blessing in our lives. She brings tremendous joy to so many lives all around her. Her 
presence has helped them. And that people with disabilities are just like us when I saw that 
clip of Donald Trump mocking somebody with a disability. It's done me. I was shocked. You got 
to do this guy. I don't know what I said. I don't remember that reporter. He is talking about suffers 
from a chronic condition than a movement of his arms. When I saw Donald Trump mock someone with 
"a disability, it told me everything. I need to know about his heart and what he believes, deep "
down priorities. USA action is responsible
