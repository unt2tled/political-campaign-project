Far too many families today.
Don't earn what they need and
don't have the opportunities.
They deserve.
I believe families deserve
quality education for their
kids.
Child care.
They can trust and afford
"equal, pay for women and jobs,"
they can really live on
people.
Ask me what will be different
if I'm president.
"Well, kids and families."
Have been the passion of my
life and they will be the heart
of my presidency.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I
approve
