You Washington politicians side with polluters over families. They sure do. Because big all 
pumps Millions into their campaigns. Bernie Sanders is the only candidate for president who 
"opposes fracking everywhere, why? Because fracking pumps dangerous cancer-causing chemicals, "
"into the ground, and threatens our drinking water. Bernie. He can't be bought by them because "
he's funded by you. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
