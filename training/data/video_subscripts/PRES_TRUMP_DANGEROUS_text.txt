"Our next president faces daunting challenges in a dangerous World. Iran promoting terrorism, "
"North Korea, threatening Isis On The Rise Libya and North Africa in chaos. Hillary Clinton "
failed every single time as Secretary of State. Now. She wants to be president. Hillary Clinton 
doesn't have the fortitude strength or stamina to lead in our world. She failed a secretary 
of state. Don't let her fail us again. I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message.
