"Most nurses are tough. They're problem, solvers. They like making things better. People don't "
have access to healthcare because they just can't afford it. Bernie Sanders understands how 
pharmaceutical companies and major medical companies are ripping us off. Bernie tells the 
"truth, and he's been consistent. He understands that the system is rigged and he's the only "
one who can bring real change. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
