Jeb Bush was very strong governor and probably the strongest governor in the history of the 
State of Florida. He was a young guy and I think there's some folks legislature that thought 
they might be able to run over him. That didn't happen.  
"One tax cut wasn't enough. He had to do more. It wasn't enough to have 15,000 kids to school choice "
"in Florida. He wanted to have 100,000 kids. If he didn't like a project, it was going to be veto. "
It didn't matter. If you were a republican. It didn't matter if you were his best friend. He said 
this is where we're going. And this is how we're going to reform state government. Every politician 
"comes in talking about making change and generally, there's not much change the governor Bush "
made a lot of changes. He got the nickname Vito Corleone. He saw something in the budget that 
he thought violated his conservative principles. You could guarantee it was going to get whacked 
"stuff and I was the Senate President, the message to Washington, d.c. Is get ready because there "
will be change rate to rise. USA is responsible for the content of this message.
