You do have a choice for president and a time. When black lives matter. We have mass incarceration 
and our communities are desperately needing economic advancement. Do you have a choice to 
let your voice be heard? Dr. Willie Wilson is one of us and running for president. From the son 
"of a champ. Proper to a self-made, millionaire. Willie Wilson. Understand what we need because "
he's been there. I'm going to Wilson's candidate for president and I approve this message and 
you have a voice and a choice for president.
