"in this debate illustrate, why? The American people don't trust the media. This is not a cage "
match. You look at the question. Donald Trump. Are you a comic book? Villain Ben? Carson? Can 
you do math? John Kasich? Will you insult to people over here? Marco Rubio? Why don't you resign 
Jeb Bush why I have your numbers Fallen. How about talking about the substantive issues? The 
media can't silence in Washington can't break it. It because everyone knows exactly where 
"he stands. If I'm elected, president enemies across this world will know the United States "
"is not to be trifled with will kill. The terrorists. Will repeal Obamacare, and we will defend "
the Constitution every single word crystal-clear Vision. Strong on its leadership. That's 
what it takes to win. I can't wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton. Ted Cruz 
for president. I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message.
