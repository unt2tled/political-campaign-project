"This election is about the essence of America, about all of us who feel out of place in our own "
"country, a government incredibly out of touch and millions with Traditional Values. Branded "
"bigots and haters. This is about wages, growing slower than the cost of living a generation "
"drowning in debt and a president humiliated by Putin Iran and Islamic jihadist. I'm Marco Rubio, "
I approve this message because this is about the greatest country in the world. And acting like 
it.
