"My parents, they have a renewed"
of different patients.
I'm scared for them because of
the dislocation.
That's good.
I'm gonna do everything I can
"to, you don't have to be"
scared.
So you don't have to worry
about
what happened.
"Really, really strongly that"
"you're being very brave,"
and you have to be brave for
them to.
They want you to be happy.
They want you to be successful.
They don't want you to worry
too much.
Let me do the worrying.
I'll do all the worries that a
deal.
I'll do the worry.
I'll do everything I can to
help.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I
approve this message.
