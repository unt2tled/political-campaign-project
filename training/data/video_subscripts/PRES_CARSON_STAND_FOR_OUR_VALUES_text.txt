Here's the real issue.
Do we still have standards?
Do we still have values and
principles?
You see all the divisiveness
and the hatred that goes on in
our society.
Where did that Spirit come from
an America?
"It did not come from our judeo,"
Christian Roots.
The majority of people in
"America, actually have values"
and principles and they believe
in the very things that made
America.
Great.
It's time for us to stand up
for what we believe in.
I'm Ben Carson and I approve
this message.
