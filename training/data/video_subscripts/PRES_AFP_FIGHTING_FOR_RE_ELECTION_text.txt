"In 2008, I supported Barack Obama. I really connected with his message of hope and change. He "
"was going to cut the deficit, was going to bring us jobs. And if you look at his record, none of "
those came him to fruition. I don't feel like he's fighting for me. I feel like he's fighting 
for reelection. I definitely feel disappointed. So many things did not come true. Americans
