"Gary Johnson on the candidate for president of the United States. And I approve this message, "
"the next president of the United States of America, Gary Johnson,  "
"and he came into the governorship in New Mexico, is his first elective office, and he really "
"did change things. I mean, he was rated one of the most fiscally conservative governors in the "
United States during his terms in office. Gary is one of the most honest people. I've met also 
"almost painfully honest. I think of him is honest Johnson, and he would never ever, ever tell "
"something to the voters that he didn't think, was true. I think he'd be a pretty great president, "
"and I have more excited than I can tell you that the prospect of working alongside our you in 2016, "
our best America yet. What's the America you in? Come on.
