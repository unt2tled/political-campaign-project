"I've seen what can happen as a result of hate. My son. Mac was murdered in Laramie, Wyoming in "
1998. He was befriended by two men. In a bar who pretended to be gay. They offered him a ride home 
"and when he was in their car, they robbed him and beat him. They drove Matt how to the Prairie and "
tied him to a split rail fence. Then beat him some more and left him for dead and the aftermath 
of Max death. My family saw the best of America in the love and support. We were shocked. So when 
I see the hate that Donald Trump has brought to his campaign for president. It terrifies me like 
"to punch him in the face. I'll tell you, I don't know what I said. He's a Mexican I could stand in "
"the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't words have an influence violence "
"causes pain. Hate can rip us apart. I know what can happen as a result of hate, and Donald Trump "
should never be our president. Priorities. USA action is responsible for the content of this
