"There are those who say we cannot defeat a corrupt political system and fix a rigged economy, "
but I believe we need to lift our vision above the obstacles in place and look to the American 
Horizon to a nation where every child can not only dream of going to college. But a 10-1 where 
"Quality Health Care will be a Birthright of every citizen where a good job is not a wish, but a "
reality where women receive equal pay and a living wage is Paid to all and America were after 
a lifetime of Labor. There is high for rats and grandchildren a nation that defends our people 
"and our values, but no longer carries so much of that burden alone. I know we can create that America "
if we listen to our conscience and our heart and not to the pundits and the naysayers. I'm Bernie 
Sanders and I approve this message and I ask for your vote.
