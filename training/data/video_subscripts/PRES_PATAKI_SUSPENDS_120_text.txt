"Hi, I'm George Pataki. I'm has honor to lead the people of New York State as governor for over "
"a decade. I brought to that job the values. I learned growing up on a small, family farm in the "
"Hudson Valley, the values of hard work, Family, Faith and Community, but mostly what I brought "
was a belief in America that tomorrow would always be better and that is a free people. We could 
"accomplish anything today, too. Many Americans feel. Their children's future won't be. As "
"bright as their own, they are frightened by the prospect of radical Islam attacking us here "
and frightened by a government in Washington that grows more and more powerful. If we're truly 
"going to make America great again. We need to elect a president who will do three things, confront, "
"and defeat, radical Islam. Shrink the size and power of Washington, and Unitas again in our "
"belief, in this great country, as governor on September 11th. Yes. I saw unspeakable horror "
"But I also saw Americans United as never before, and when  "
Americans can do when we stand shoulder to shoulder on that day and the days that follow we weren't 
"black or white, rich, or poor Republican or Democrat. We were just Americans. We need to recapture "
"that spirit because I know when we stand together, there is nothing. We cannot accomplish while "
"tonight is the end of my journey for the White House, as I suspend my campaign for president. "
"I'm confident we can elect the right person, someone who will bring us together and it understands "
that politicians including the president must be the people service and not their masks. I 
know the best of America is still ahead of us. Happy New Year. May God bless you. And may God bless 
the United States of America. I'm George Pataki and I approve this message.
