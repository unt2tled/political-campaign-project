The stuff some folks are saying about President Obama sounds kind of familiar. The same people 
"said my ideas would destroy jobs and they called me every name in the book. Well, we created 22 "
million new jobs and turned deficits into surpluses. President Obama's got it right. We should 
invest in the middle class education and innovation and pay down our debt with spending restraints 
"and asking wealthy to pay a little more. Sound familiar? I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this "
message.
