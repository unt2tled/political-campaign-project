"Jobs, Freedom security. That's what's at stake. And that's why I'm supporting Ted Cruz for "
president. Ted is a constitutional conservative. He'll challenge the status quo. Just like 
we've done in Wisconsin and 10 is a real plan to grow jobs and restore opportunity on Tuesday. 
Please join me in supporting Ted Cruz. The only conservative who can beat Hillary Clinton and 
reignite America's promise. I'm Ted Cruz and I approve this message.
