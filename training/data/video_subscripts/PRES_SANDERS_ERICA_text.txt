This is everything that I have my family. I got to see my dad died on national TV. They don't know 
what they took from us. People are dying. We need a president that's going to talk about it. I 
believe early families is a protester. He's not scared to go up against the criminal justice 
system. He's not scared. That's why I'm from various. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this 
message.
