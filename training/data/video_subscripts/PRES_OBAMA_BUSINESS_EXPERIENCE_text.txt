"I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message. When Mitt Romney led BAYone, hundreds of plants, "
"factories and stores were shuttered. Workers saw their wages slashed, their jobs sent overseas. "
Romney made a fortune. Now he wants to bring that business experience to us. He'd keep tax breaks 
"for outsourcing and hand new tax cuts to millionaires, all while raising taxes on the middle "
class. Romney is not the solution. He's the problem. He's.
