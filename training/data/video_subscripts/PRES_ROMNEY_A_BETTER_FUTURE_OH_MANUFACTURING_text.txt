This President can ask us to be patient. This President can tell us it was someone else's fault. 
But this President cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office here 
in Ohio. We're not better off under President Obama. His failed economic American trade policies 
with China have destroyed thousands of jobs. The Romney plan. Stand up to China. Create over 
4500 new jobs. Keep Ohio jobs in Ohio. I met Romney and I approve this message.
