They served our country. Our country should serve them better. Bernie Sanders crack the gridlock 
with John McCain to help clean up the mess at the VA and strengthen Veteran's Health Care. Bernie 
Sanders has always stood with our veterans and that's why he'll never rush to put our men and 
women In Harm's Way judgment Integrity. Bernie. I'm Bernie Sanders. And I approve this message.
