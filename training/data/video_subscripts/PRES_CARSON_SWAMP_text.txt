"Did you know, Washington is"
"built on a swamp,"
"massive government debt,"
"dining regulation,"
special interest politics
"partisan, dysfunction."
"Now, it all makes sense."
"Washington is broken,"
"the political class, broken"
together.
We can drain the swamp
and protect our children's
future.
I'm Ben Carson and I approve
this message.
