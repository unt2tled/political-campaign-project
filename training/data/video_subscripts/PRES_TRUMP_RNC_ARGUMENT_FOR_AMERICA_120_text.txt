Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government 
"controls by you. The American people, The Establishment has trillions of dollars at stake "
"in this election, for those who control the levers of power in Washington. And for the global "
"special engines, they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind. The political "
establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade 
"deals, massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country "
dry. The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our 
"jobs, as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries all around. The world. It's a global "
power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working-class. 
Stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations 
and political entities. The only thing that  
"can stop this corrupt machine is you the only Force strong enough to save our country is Us, the "
only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you the American people 
"for the people, and for the movement, and we will take back this country for you and we will make "
America great again.  
I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message.
