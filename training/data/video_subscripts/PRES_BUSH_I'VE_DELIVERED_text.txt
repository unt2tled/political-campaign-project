We have an important choice to
make about the direction of our
country.
If you want more DC politicians
"or more self-promoters, you've"
got options.
I'm offering something
"different leadership, ideas and"
a proven conservative record as
Governor.
"I cut taxes,"
cut spending balanced budget
and Florida led the nation in
job creation.
Anybody can talk I've delivered
and I hope to earn your
support.
I'm Jeb Bush and I approve this
message.
