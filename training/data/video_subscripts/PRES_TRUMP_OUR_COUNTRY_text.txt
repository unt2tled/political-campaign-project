I'm Donald Trump. And I approve this message. We are going to take our country and we're going 
to fix it. We're going to make it great. Again. We are going to fix our house. We are going to take 
care of our best. We are going to fix our military. We are going to strengthen our borders. We're 
"going to build the wall, but we are going to strengthen our borders. We are going to make it great "
again. We're going to make it greater than ever before.
