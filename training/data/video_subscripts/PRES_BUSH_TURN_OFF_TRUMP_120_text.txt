Where I could stand in the
middle of Fifth Avenue and
shoot somebody and I wouldn't
lose any voters.
"Okay,"
is that a war hero?
He's a war hero.
"A, he's a war hero because he"
was captured.
I like people that weren't
captured.
"No, I mean, he insulted every"
veteran with these insane
statements about how this is
your fault that you're captured
or shot down.
And with total lack of respect.
Donald Trump facing new
criticism.
He's here to mock a reporter
with a disability.
Are you got to see this guy?
I don't know what I said.
I don't remember.
When seeing Carly fiorina on
TV?
"Look at that face, would anyone"
vote for that?
Can you imagine that the face
of our next President?
Donald Trump has a woman
problem
where I could stand in the
middle of Fifth Avenue and
shoot somebody and I wouldn't
lose any voters.
Okay.
I'm sick.
And tired of politicians Define
ways to disparage people to
make themselves look strong.
It is not strong
to insult women.
It is not a sign of strength.
It is not a sign of strength.
"When you say that appeal, W is"
a loser because they got
"caught, John McCain is a hero."
It is not a sign of strength.
Disparaging the disabled in
this country.
"It is not, it is a sign of"
"deep, insecurity and weakness."
I hope you want someone who has
a heart for people.
I hope you have one.
Someone who has a spine to
"stand on principle, has a"
proven record to show it.
You want a president that is
commander-in-chief will have a
steady hand.
That won't say the craziest
stuff in the world.
Insecurity for us and for the
troops that we count on to keep
us safe.
So you all have this incredible
opportunity.
You have the responsibility of
reshaping this race.
I have total confidence and
belief that you will make the
right choice.
"I humbly ask for your support,"
"and I promise you should, I be"
our party's nominee.
I will unite around common
purpose and the conservative
cause and I will defeat Hillary
Clinton and we will restore
America's greatness.
I'm Jeb Bush and I approve this
message.
No.
