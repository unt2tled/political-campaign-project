Over the next four months, you have a choice to make, not just between two political parties or even two people. It's a choice between two very different plans for our country.

We tried that top down approach. That's what caused the mess in the first place. I believe the only way to create an economy built to last is to strengthen the middle class, asking the wealthy to pay a little more so we can pay down our debt in a balanced way so that we can afford to invest in education, anufacturing and homegrown.

For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we must do better. I know how to revive the American dream. I will not let you down.

In 2008, I voted for President Obama with no reluctance. He presented himself as something  different.

He said he was going to cut the deficit in his first term. I've seen zero interest in  reducing spending. He inherited a bad situation, but he made it worse. I think he's a great person.  I don't feel he is the right leader for our country, though. I still believe in hope and change.  I just don't think Obama is the way to go for that. The President has not earned reelection in 2012. In my book, I've seen his now definition hope and change. It's not the hope and change I  want. It's not the hope and change I thought I was going to get.
