"This president, with all due respect, beliefs, that America's leadership and presence in "
the world is not a Force. For good America has led the world and it is a more peaceful world when 
we're engaged the right way. We do not have to be the world's policeman. We have to be the world's 
"leader. We have to stand for the values of Freedom, who's going to take care of the Christians "
"that are being eliminated in the Middle East, but for the United States, who who's going to stand "
"up for the dissidents inside of Iran, that are brutal? Lies each and every day, but for the United "
"States, who who's going to take care of Israel and support them, our greatest Ally in the Middle "
"East, but for the United States, no one, no one is capable of doing this. The United States has "
the capability of doing this and it's in our economic and National Security interests that 
we do it. I will be that kind of President and I hope you want that kind of present for our country 
going forward. Thank you guys. USA is responsible
