"As president, I will defend this nation, but I will do it. Responsibly. I voted against the war "
"in Iraq, and that was the right vote. We must never forget the lessons that experience. Isis "
"must be destroyed, but we should not do it alone. We need an International Coalition with Muslim "
boots on the ground fighting with our support. It's time to end the plaque. Maya of Perpetual 
Warfare in the Middle East as president. I will. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
