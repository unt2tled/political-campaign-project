I support Bernie Sanders because I think that his ideas are much more Forward Thinking and Innovative 
than any of the other candidates when Bernie Sanders is engaging with the black lives matter 
movement. It's proof positive that he doesn't just give lip service to being supportive of 
"issues that matter to people of color in this country. And when he is elected, we will see long-overdue "
changes to our criminal justice system. That continues to criminalize people just for being 
black. I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this This message.
