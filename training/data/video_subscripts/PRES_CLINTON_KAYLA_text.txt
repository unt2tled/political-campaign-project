I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message. When Taylor was nine his diagnosis to Chronic 
"illnesses. It was heartbreaking to watch her, go through this, my husband and I both work, but "
the medicine she needed would cost thousands when Hillary Clinton was first lady. She was instrumental 
in passing the children's health insurance program and because he did Kayla and millions of 
other kids have coverage. That's what Hillary Clinton did. And that tells you a lot about the 
kind of president. She'll be.
