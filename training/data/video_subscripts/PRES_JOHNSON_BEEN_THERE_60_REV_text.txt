"I'm Governor, Gary Johnson. I'm Governor Bill. Weld. I'm running for president. I'm running "
"with him. As the governor of New Mexico ID tag wasteful spending 750 times, cut taxes, 14 times "
"and left. The state would new highways Bridges schools, hospitals, and a billion dollar Surplus "
without raising taxes up. Any as governor of Massachusetts. I cut taxes 21 times and took unemployment 
"from the highest rate among the 11, industrialized states to the lowest and he did that in his "
first term. It was easy difference between the two of us and the other candidates running for 
president is that we Been there and done that. Give us one term America and if after four years 
you decide you don't like peace prosperity and freedom. You can always vote a trump or Hillary 
"back into office again Johnson. Well, 2016, our best America yet. What's that America? You "
