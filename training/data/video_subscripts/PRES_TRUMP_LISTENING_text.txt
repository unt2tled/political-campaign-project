"I love being a mom. But no matter how hard we work. We can't get ahead, child care costs have us "
stuck. Donald Trump is listening. My child care plan allows for every family in America to deduct 
their child care expenses from their income taxes. His child care plan makes a difference for 
"Working Families, more money, more freedom. He's helping American just like us. I'm Donald "
Trump and I approve this message. Yes.
