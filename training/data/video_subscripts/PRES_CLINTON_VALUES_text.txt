I became active in the Republican party to elect Ronald Reagan. I thought I would be able to support 
"whoever the Republican candidate was. I always have but with Trump on the ballot, I just can't. "
"He does not hold my values or the values of the party. He's unfit, you unqualified and I see Hillary "
Clinton as someone who's had the experience nationally and internationally to be our leader. 
I will vote for what's best for our country's. So I'm going to vote for Hillary Clinton. I'm Hillary 
Clinton and I approve this message.
