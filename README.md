# Political Campaign Project
Deep learning pipelines to predict the target of political messages.
## About
The goal of this project is to present machine learning approach of classification political campaign videos from the USA of different years by target audience (base/center). The classification is done by extracting different features from the video (e.g., speech-to-text, visual data) and training a neural network. More details can be found in the related [paper]().
## Navigation
### Features extraction
All the code used for features extraction is in the tools directory.
### Training model
To train the model use Google Colab.
### Demo
Example UI of a pre-trained model with test accuracy of ~80% using speech-to-text and text from video features can be found [here](https://unt2tled-political-campaign-project-demo-6gbfbd.streamlitapp.com/).
