Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_transform.weight', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_projector.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_layer_norm.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).
The following columns in the training set don't have a corresponding argument in `DistilBertForSequenceClassification.forward` and have been ignored: text. If text are not expected by `DistilBertForSequenceClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_transform.weight', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_projector.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_layer_norm.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).

Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_transform.weight', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_projector.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_layer_norm.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).

Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_transform.weight', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_projector.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_layer_norm.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).

Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_transform.weight', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_projector.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_layer_norm.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).
The following columns in the training set don't have a corresponding argument in `DistilBertForSequenceClassification.forward` and have been ignored: text. If text are not expected by `DistilBertForSequenceClassification.forward`,  you can safely ignore this message.
