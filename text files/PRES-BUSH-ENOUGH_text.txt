Just one other thing.
I got to get this off.
My chest.
Donald Trump is a jerk.
Donald Trump facing new
criticism.
He appeared to Ma so reporter
with a disability.
I don't know what I said.
I don't remember when anybody
disparages people with
disabilities.
It set me off.
That's why I called him a jerk.
What kind of person would you
want to have in the presidency
that does that what point do we
"say, enough of this?"
Let's start solving problems.
I'm Jeb Bush and I approve this
message.
Ouch.
