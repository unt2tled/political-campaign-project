It's very dangerous world.
We need a strong leader to take
a seat at that desk and make
the hard decisions.
This is no reality show.
"This is serious business, this"
nation hungers for leadership.
We need Jim Bush.
Jeb Bush will rebuild our
military and make us proud to
be Americans.
You'll have the American
"people's confidence, and he"
will be respected on the world
stage.
I'm Jeb Bush and I approve this
message.
