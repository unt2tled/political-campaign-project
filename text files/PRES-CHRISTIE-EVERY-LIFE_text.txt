"See, I'm pro-life and I believe"
that every life is precious.
Not only for the baby in the
womb.
We need to be pro-life for the
16 year old drug addict who's
laying on the floor of the
county jail.
And so that's why I.
"So, firmly, believe in a way to"
really win.
The war on drugs.
Used to treat the attic for
those whose lives.
We have a chance to save.
I want to try to save those
lives because I believe that
every one of those lives is
precious gift from God.
And it's not up to us to decide
when that light face.
I'm Chris Christie and I
approve this message.
