Title: PRES-AFF-MICHAEL-WALTZ

I'm Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz.  

I've served multiple tours in Afghanistan, as a special  

forces Commander.  

Donald Trump hasn't served this country a day in his life.  

Essentially, dodged, the draft in Vietnam, through multiple  

deferments.  

He's been fed through a silver spoon went to boarding school.  

Says, it was so tough.  

He felt like he was in the military.

You look into his real record and stop Trump.
