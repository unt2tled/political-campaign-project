I've known Hillary Clinton for
"20 years, and I'm supporting"
her for president.
She's a smartest hardest
working toughest.
Most experienced person that I
"know, and that's kind of what"
you need in a president.
If you care about the things I
"do making College affordable,"
"expanding Mental Health Care,"
"making those at the top, pay"
"their fair share, then you need"
someone who can actually get
the job done.
And that's Hillary.
I really hope you'll caucus for
her on March 1st.
I'm Hillary Clinton.
And I approve.
This.
