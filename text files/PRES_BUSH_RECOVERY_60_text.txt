"Today, I was at a summit"
dealing with this heroin
epidemic in this is a huge
problem.
It's not just heroin.
"It's drug addiction in general,"
and I have personal experience
in this.
As a dad.
My daughter Noelle
was addicted to drugs
and today.
I called her to tell her that I
was going to talk about her in
this public setting.
It's not easy to do
"and she said, don't do it."
I want to help.
"She was put in jail,"
then she went to drug court and
it was tough.
"If it was really hard, I can"
look in people's eyes.
And I know that they've gone
through the same thing that
"Bloomin I have, there is a"
"solution to this, but it"
requires leadership.
And here's my promise to you.
I won't be a yapper.
I'm not going to be a candidate
that's going to yell the
loudest or insult.
"The person, the most,"
"if you want, someone that can"
figure out how to solve a
problem.
That passionately goes about
the business of fixing these
things.
Then I'm your guy.
I'm Jeb Bush and I approve this
message.
Zh.
