Title: PRES-45COMMITTEE-SAME-PATH-REV

What if we stay on the same path, a stagnant Flatline  

economy, 45 million Americans living in poverty, skyrocketing  

health care, premiums America can't afford a president too  

distracted by their own endless scandals and under FBI  

investigation.  

There's only one way to stop the constant Clinton scandals,  

and make America strong again on November 8, vote for Real  

Change.  

45 committee is responsible for the content.
