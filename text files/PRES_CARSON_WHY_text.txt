"Our children,"
dear future.
Nothing is more important.
I'm Ben Carson people ask why I
ran for president because our
children face a very harsh
future unsustainable debt.
Future Generations will suffer
at ten million dollars a day
for five thousand years.
It still won't be repaid.
Washington is broken.
"The political class broken,"
please join me for their sick.
I'm Ben Carson and I approve
this message.
