There's no one else
"is running for president, and"
States was actually been
responsible for prosecuting
investigating terrorist.
Hillary Clinton will be nothing
more than a third term of
Barack Obama.
She was one of the architects
of this foreign policy.
We need to send a clear and
strong message to our
adversaries that there are
clear limits to your conduct.
And if you violate those in
America is going to hold you to
account the president.
That would be the top priority
to protect the lives of the
people of the United States of
America.
"I'm Chris Christie, and I"
approve this message.
