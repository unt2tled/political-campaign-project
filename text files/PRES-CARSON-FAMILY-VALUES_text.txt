Family Values are key.
"You know, I see these young"
people here to reminds me so
much of my career as a
pediatric neurosurgeon.
It was really because I had the
faith in God that they may take
on some of those challenging
"cases and Faith informs, what"
kind of person you are and how
you relate to other people.
And a lot of it has to do with
"our values in the principles,"
and we should really be in.
"No, hurry to give those away"
for the sake of political
correctness.
I'm Ben Carson and I approve
this message.
