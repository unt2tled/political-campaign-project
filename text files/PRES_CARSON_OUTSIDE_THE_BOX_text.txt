I'm Ben Carson and I'm running
for president the political
class and their pundit buddy
say impossible.
He's to outside the box.
"Well, they do know impossible"
impossible to balance the
budget and possible to get
border security and possible to
put aside partisanship.
I'm Ben Carson.
I'm running for president and
I'm very much outside the box.
You must be a good idea in
"there, somewhere."
I'm Ben Carson and I approve
this message.
