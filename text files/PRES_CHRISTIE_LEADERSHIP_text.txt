"Your ship matters, it matters"
for our country and American
leadership matters for the
world.
"But if we're going to leave, we"
have to stop worrying about
being loved and start caring
about being respected.
Again.
I am not looking to be the most
popular guy who looks in your
eyes every day and try to
figure out what you want to
hear.
Say it and then turn around and
do something else.
"I mean, when I say and I say"
"what I mean, and that's what"
America needs right now.
I'm Chris Christie.
I approve this message.
