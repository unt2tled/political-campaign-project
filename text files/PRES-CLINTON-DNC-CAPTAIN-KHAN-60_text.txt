"In 2004,"
my son was stationed in Iraq.
She saw her suicide bomber
approaching his and
my son
moved forward to stop the
bomber.
When the bomb exploded.
"He saved everyone in his unit,"
only one.
American Soldier died.
My son was kept in.
He my own car.
He was 27 years old
and he was a Muslim American.
I want to ask.
Mr.
Trump.
Would my son
have a place in your America?
I'm Hillary Clinton and I
approve this message.
