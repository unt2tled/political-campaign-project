I will be president
many voices are raised
shrill boastful full of
"themselves,"
but then there's one more
"thoughtful strong, a brilliant"
"surgeon, whose inner strength"
and principle life speaks for
"itself, serving others, saving"
"lives, serving God, who will be"
president.
Perhaps the answer is not
screaming to be heard.
I'm Ben Carson and I approve
this.
