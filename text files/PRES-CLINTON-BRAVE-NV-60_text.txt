I'm not sure
my parents.
They have a lot of different
patients.
I'm scared for them because how
does it would take to I'm
scared that
I'm gonna do everything I can
"to, you don't have to be scared"
so you don't have to worry
about
what happened.
"Somebody else, just"
"really, really strongly that"
you be very brave
and just be brave for them to
if they want you to be happy.
They want you to be successful.
They don't want you to worry
too much.
Let me do the worrying.
I'll do all the worrying.
Is that a deal?
I'll do the worry.
I'll do everything.
I can to help.
I'm Hillary Clinton and I
approve this message.
