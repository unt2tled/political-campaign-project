Do not be fooled any
significant division within the
Republican Party leads to the
same awful results.
Hillary Rodham Clinton in
"January of 2017, taking the"
oath of office as president
United States.
This country cannot afford that
outcome.
"And thus, we Republicans have a"
duty.
I believe a profound moral duty
to work together.
I'm Chris Christie and I
approve this message.
