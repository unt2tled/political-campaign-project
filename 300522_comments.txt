packages for correction to text:
words, connection of sentences and truncation (comma or dot in wrong places) - V by-hand
preproccess for data
removes non-standard
true, but we extract text for now
Some are obvious and some are not
It could be by text package, it could be rule base (as each five words remove a dot)
KEEP IT SIMPLE
*** CLEAN THE DATA *** (can advance model)
HUMAN FACTOR FOR FIXING TEXTS (for the first time)
think what we would like to fix
THE RIGHT THING: check pre-process
ANOTHER RECOMMENDED FEATURE: check who's talking (race conditions)
take database of pictures of all congress participants
PERFORMANCE: 3-label
confusion matrix: for each class see ground truth
if it's uniform then it sucks
Check if the pattern is always for choosing base over center/both
MUSIC EXTRACTION (semantic)
Let's be pragmatic VS dive into feature
Start from promising model and then spread to other
Bring baseline of the model
